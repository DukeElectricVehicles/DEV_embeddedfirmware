# INA226 Test and Calibration

This program tests to make sure the INA is soldered properly and also helps with calibration

To check that things are reading properly, type `d` on startup to print the "debug" values (aka the voltage, current, power, and alert values).

To perform calibration, measure the current/voltage with a multimeter then type "I#" where # is the current or type "V#" where # is the voltage.  For example, if you connect a battery that you measure to be 20.5V, type
	```V20.5```
If you then apply a 530mA load, type
	```I0.530```

Once you get enough data points, you can type `p` to view the data points you have collected, then type `=` to calculate the calibration and offsets.



As a convenience, you can type `D#` to apply a duty cycle across A/B phases with an ESC that has an INA chip.  For example, typing `D0.5` will pull phase A to ground and phase B at a 50% duty cycle (non-syncronous).

spindown_noRotor
	May 24 evening, spindown test with mitsuba motor and shimano hub with sprocket but no rotor - I can't recall whether the rotor was completely off or whether it was just flipped upside down or something
	chain was tensioned by pulling bolt back with hand while tightening the m10 bolt on top
	sprockets were aligned with calipers measured from the top of the top plate then spinning by hand and viewing horizontally as a "check"
spindown_noRotor_2
	May 25 evening, mitsuba motor and shimano hub with sprocket but no rotor at all, it was completely off
	same procedures as previous test, not sure why it was so much less drag
spindown_noRotor_3
	May 25 evening, same as previous test; took out motor then put back in and redid the sprocket to try to figure out what the standard deviation was for these tests
	It had almost exactly the same result - only about 3% different
	I forgot to tension the chain in this test, but actually there was less drag, interestingly enough
spindown_noRotor_4
	May 25 evening, placed the rotor on the hub but upside down to see if maybe there's some eddy current/magnetic effects at semi-long distances
	don't know why it's so much worse
	edit: the next test shows that I must have over tightened the chain
spindown_noRotor_5
	May 25 evening, same as previous but loosened the chain - apparently it actually did better this time

notes:
	*	if you get something that looks obviously wrong (power vs speed curve is wavy, looks like a sideways 'S'), it's probably because the sprocket on the flywheel side slipped down or something - check that it's aligned properly and tighten the set screw
	*	chain losses are such a mystery
